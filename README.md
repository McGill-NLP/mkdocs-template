# Mkdocs Template

This template is useful for building the documentations for your McGill-NLP project. It uses [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). You can start by editing the content in `docs/`. If you need to edit the configurations and/or deploy mkdocs, start with the official [Getting Started](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

To edit the title, go to `mkdocs.yml` and change the `site_name` field.
